## 🔒 Want to Protect Your Data?

When sharing, you can turn on **"Encrypt with password"**:
- Your tasks will be locked with a password
- The person receiving them will need that password to open them
- Uses strong AES-256-GCM encryption

**Make sure to share the password separately!**

## 📱 Where Can I Share?

- 📧 Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- 💬 WhatsApp
- 📱 Telegram  
- 📸 Instagram (limited support)
- 💼 Any app that accepts files
- And more!

## 💡 Tips

- **For safety**: Always use encryption when sharing sensitive tasks
- **For convenience**: Share without encryption when sharing with yourself
- **Selection mode**: Tap the ✕ button to exit without sharing
- **Quick share**: "Share All Tasks" is perfect for backups
