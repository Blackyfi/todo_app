# Pull Request Template

This repository uses a pull request template to ensure all PRs have consistent and comprehensive descriptions.

## What is a PR Template?

When you create a new pull request on GitHub, the `.github/pull_request_template.md` file is automatically loaded into the PR description field. This provides a standardized format for describing your changes.

## How to Use the Template

1. **Description**: Provide a clear, concise summary of what your PR does
2. **Related Issue**: Link the issue this PR addresses (e.g., "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456")
3. **Type of Change**: Check the boxes that apply to your PR
4. **Changes Made**: List the specific changes you made
5. **Testing**: Check the platforms you tested on and whether you added tests
6. **Screenshots/Videos**: If your changes affect the UI, include visuals
7. **Checklist**: Go through the checklist to ensure your PR is ready
8. **Additional Notes**: Add any extra context reviewers should know

## Why This Matters

Having comprehensive PR descriptions helps with:
- **Code Review**: Reviewers can quickly understand what changed and why
- **Documentation**: Future developers can understand the evolution of the codebase
- **Project History**: Makes it easier to track features and bug fixes
- **Collaboration**: Reduces back-and-forth questions about unclear changes

## Example PRs

Some existing PRs with good descriptions that follow best practices:
- PR #42: French language support
- PR #41: Notification sound enhancements
- PR #40: Enable sound for task reminders
- PR #38: Security and authentication flow refactor

## Tips

- Don't leave the template sections empty - fill them out thoughtfully
- If a section doesn't apply, you can remove it or write "N/A"
- Be specific in your descriptions - vague descriptions like "fixed bugs" aren't helpful
- Reference issues and related PRs when applicable
- Include testing details - what did you test and how?

## Questions?

If you have questions about the PR template or need help filling it out, please ask in the issue or reach out to the maintainers.
