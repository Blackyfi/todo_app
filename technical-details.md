# Todo App - Technical Details

## Architecture Overview

The Todo App follows a feature-based architecture with a clean separation of concerns, designed for maintainability, testability, and scalability. The architecture emphasizes cross-platform compatibility and robust error handling.

### Project Structure

The application is organized by feature rather than by type, promoting better code organization and team collaboration:

```bash
lib/
├── common/       # Shared components, constants, themes, widgets
├── core/         # Core functionality (database, notifications, logging, providers)
└── features/     # Feature modules (tasks, categories, statistics, settings)
```

Each feature contains its own:

- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Screens**: UI components and user interactions
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI elements specific to the feature
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### Design Patterns & Principles

The app employs several proven design patterns:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic with comprehensive error handling
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Used for services that should have only one instance (Logger, Database)
3. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating instances of models from different data sources
4. **Provider Pattern**: Used for state management with ChangeNotifier
5. **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected where needed for better testability

## Advanced Code Standards & Conventions

### Import Aliasing Strategy

All imports follow a strict aliasing pattern to prevent name conflicts and improve code readability:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' as mat;
import 'package:todo_app/features/tasks/models/task.dart' as task_model;
import 'package:todo_app/core/database/repository/task_repository.dart' as task_repository;
```

### Code Organization Principles

- **File Size Limit**: Strict 200-line limit per .dart file for maintainability
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose and responsibility
- **Functional Grouping**: Related functionality is grouped together logically
- **Private Encapsulation**: Private methods and variables are prefixed with underscore

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: snake_case.dart for all file names
- **Classes**: PascalCase for all class names
- **Variables and methods**: camelCase for all variables and method names
- **Constants**:

  - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for top-level constants
  - camelCase within constant classes for consistency

## Enhanced Database Implementation

### Cross-Platform SQLite Integration

The app uses SQLite for local data storage with cross-platform support:

- **Mobile Platforms**: Native sqflite package for Android and iOS
- **Desktop Platforms**: sqflite_common_ffi for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Database Version**: 1 (with migration support for future versions)
- **Database Name**: todo_app.db
- **Features**: Foreign key support, ACID transactions, automatic indexing

### Comprehensive Database Schema

The database consists of four interconnected tables:

1. **categories**: Stores category information with color coding
2. **tasks**: Stores task information with optional category relationships
3. **notificationSettings**: Stores flexible notification preferences per task
4. **autoDeleteSettings**: Stores application-wide cleanup configuration

### Advanced Repository Pattern

Each entity has a dedicated repository with comprehensive functionality:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete with proper error handling
- **Complex Queries**: Advanced filtering by category, priority, date ranges, completion status
- **Data Transformation**: Seamless conversion between database and application models
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic operations for data consistency
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged with contextual information

Example repositories include:

- `TaskRepository`: Advanced task operations with completion tracking
- `CategoryRepository`: Category management with task relationship handling
- `NotificationRepository`: Notification settings with cascade delete support
