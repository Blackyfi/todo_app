# ToDo App - Technical Details

## Code Structure

### File Organization
- All source files are kept concise, with a maximum length of 200 lines per file
- Modular architecture to ensure maintainability and readability
- Separation of concerns through feature-based organization

## Coding Standards

### Import Conventions
All Dart imports must follow the aliasing pattern:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' as mat;
import 'package:todo_app/models/task.dart' as task_model;
import 'dart:async' as async;
```

### File Length
- Maximum file length: 200 lines
- Files exceeding this limit should be refactored and split into multiple files

## Database Implementation

### SQLite Integration
- The app will use SQLite for local data persistence
- Database implementation will use the `sqflite` package
- All database operations will be abstracted through a repository pattern

### Data Models
- Models will be designed to map directly to database tables
- Proper serialization/deserialization methods will be implemented
- Primary data structures:
  - Task
  - Category
  - Priority
  - Notification

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Efficient resource utilization through proper state management
- Minimal storage footprint for offline data

### Rendering Optimization
- Widget tree optimization to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- Lazy loading for list views with many items

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- All database operations will be thoroughly tested
- Model validation will have comprehensive test coverage

### Widget Tests
- UI components will have dedicated widget tests
- Interaction flows will be tested with mocked dependencies

## Dependencies Management

- Dependencies will be kept to a minimum to reduce app size
- Version pinning will be used to ensure stability
